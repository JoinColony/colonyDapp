 * @NOTE Colony Creation Wizard Flow is DISABLED

 * leaving the User creation flow still operational.
 * Due to this we've had to segment the steps array, and return just the user one in
 * case of a user without claimed account who also wants to create a new colony.
 *
 * This will first register a username, then redirect to the colony flow (which will be
 * skipping the create user step), which currently is disabled
 *
 * Also, this file has been severly gutten to accomodate this change, so please
 * restore it from history when this is no longer needed
