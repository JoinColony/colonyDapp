## Prerequisites
(for versions see package.json -> engines)
* Node.js
* Yarn

## Installation

Clone this repository :)

### Provision dependent libraries

This project depends on external libraries, so after cloning, they need to be provisioned:
```bash
yarn provision
```

Under the hood, this will initialize the `submodule`s, install their packages, and build them.

### Install packages

```bash
yarn
```

### Define environment variables

Firstly copy the example env file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then customize the variables in the `.env` file to your needs.

When adding a new environment variable, you must add it to both files _(otherwise, the `dotenv-webpack` plugin will throw an error)_; this is designed to keep the expected environment defined in a simple way.

To use the environment variables in the dApp:

```js
const { MY_API_URL } = process.env;
console.log(MY_API_URL); // https://my-api-url.example.com/api
```

## Running dev environment

```bash
yarn dev
```

Webpack dev server will be available under http://localhost:8080

Then start & setup the blockchain system from the `colonyNetwork` repo:

```bash
cd colonyNetwork
yarn start:blockchain:client
truffle migrate --reset --compile-all
trufflepig -g test-accounts.json
```

## Building the bundle locally

If you want to build the bundle locally for inspection, you can do it via:
```bash
yarn build
````

_Note: It's a straight-up dev build. Just bundled, no code optimizations whatsoever._

## Linting

Linting your code via `eslint` can be done as such:
```bash
yarn lint
```

To lint the project's style sheets you run:
```bash
yarn stylelint
```

## Type checking

Type checking using `flow` can be accessed using this npm script:
```bash
yarn flow
```

## Testing

To run unit tests you have the following npm script:

```bash
yarn test
```
